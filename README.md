# Open Chemistry Robotics and Automation (OChRA) framework
OChRA is an open-source framework for building and operating Self-Driving Labs (SDLs) for materials and chemistry research. It provides a flexible and robust control and orchestration layers.

The framework is designed to tackle common SDL challenges like hardware integration, data management, and workflow orchestration, providing a streamlined experience without a steep learning curve.

## Key Features
- :snake: **Fully Pythonic**: Experiments are defined in pure Python, making the framework easy for chemists to learn and use. It also facilitates code generation using modern tools like LLMs.
- :microscope: **Data-Centric by Design**: Data is a top priority. All operations and results are automatically stored in a database, simplifying integration with AI/ML optimizers and data pipelines.
- ⚙️ **Microservice Architecture**: The framework is built around a central lab server and independent "station" servers that can be developed concurrently. This modularity makes it easy to add new capabilities and integrate existing workflows.
- 🖥️ **Web App**: Includes a graphical application for interacting with and monitoring the status of lab stations and devices in real-time.
